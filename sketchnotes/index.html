<h1>Sketch Notes—Oh Canada</h1>

<p>I used the sketch note technique to take some notes in my ISS lecture about Canada. I only have 1 physical class a week, so notes were limited to that one class period.</p>
<h2>Ontario</h2>

<p class="caption">In a lecture about different regions of Canada, Ontario is Canada's most populated providence with 11 million people. Home of Canada's larget city, Toronto, and the nation's capital, Ottawa, Ontario has strong political power.</p>
<h2>Quebec</h2>

<p class="caption">Quebec was originally settled as a French colony which is why 82% of the population is francophone, or whose native language is French. It's considered "lower Canada" because the way the river flows which is confusing because it is more north than Ontario, "upper Canada".</p>
<h2>The North</h2>

<p class="caption">The North which to some is considered "the Frontier" is the area north of 60 degrees. It consists of territories that lack provincial status. The North has an abundance of natural resources which help Canada's economy.</p>
